Depending on the code that we've announced to each person, you have to create a different game in 3 hours. 

## Submission

- Submit the repository link of your game. 
- **Include a Widnows build of your project in a folder of your repository as well.**
- Please pay attention to the fact that the exam must be done in solo and similar codes will lose points. Codes similar to game jam submission codes or copy-pasted from the internet will also use points, so make sure to write your codes from scratch.


## Games

Codes for each person have been announced in the group chat.

### Code `1`: Develop a Pong game clone.

- If you move your side, the other side moves in the same amount and in the opposite direction.
- If you lose 3 times, you lose the game.
- No need for combos.
- Speed of the ball, and movement amount should be easily changable in your code.
