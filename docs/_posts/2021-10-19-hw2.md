HW2 is uploaded! Read the following guide for instructions.

## Setup Guide
- Repository link: [THIS LINK](https://github.com/amuuu/game-course-fall-2021)
- Unity version must be `2019.4.9f1` or higher (but not 2020 or 2021)
- Use [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) to work easier with git.

## Submission Guide

- Fork the class repository.
- You must commit your changes on the project gradually - there shouldn't be only one commit containing all the changes (so that we can decrease the code plagarism probability)
- The commits must be in your name.
- Before the deadline ends, create a pull request on the project.
- For the title of your pull request, use this format `"Merge Prototype2 HW 9752XXXX"`
- Include a video clip showing how each part of your submission plays. Put the video file inside the directory of `/game-course-fall-2021/prototype-two--food-game/HW/Video/`. Show each item in the HW that you've implemented and worked on.
- Build the project for Windows and include your export in the directory of  `/game-course-fall-2021/prototype-two--food-game/HW/Export/`.
- This HW was uploaded on **27 Mehr 1400, 15:00 (19-10-2021)**. You must submit your pull request until **7 Aban, 23:59 (29-10-2021)**.

## Homework Description

Implement and add these new features to the protoype:

### 1) New Foods

Add 3 new food types to the game. Choose from models that are in the project files.

### 2) Combo

We added the code structure in the project for adding combos in class. Add a "heart decreaser" negative combo to the project based on that structure. Use the fish bone model that exists in the models file for it. It should decrease your heart count by 1 whenever to get it.

### 3) Score and Heart in UI

We have implemented a simple UI code in previous prototype. Make a similar one here that displays score and heart count.

### 4) Balance the game

Balance the parameters in the game.

- Timer value based on score
- The comobo spawn frequency
- Plate's Movement speed
- Food weights
- Food Scores
- Any other thing you feel like it needs to be adjusted

### 5) Optional ~ (10% extra points in HW grade)

Implement the time freezer combo. When you get the combo, it should get activated and deactivated gradually, based on the following diagram:

![Time Diagram](https://github.com/amuuu/game-course-fall-2021/tree/main/docs/assets/img/hw2-7.png)

To implement this feature, you can use the timer we created in class, or use **coroutines** (search the term)
