Hello!

Your third HW is in the form of a game jam! 

Game jams are events that devs participate in to create a game often with a certain theme or subject in a short deadline.

Our game jam's theme is "Classic Game Remix." You have to choose a classic game that you like and add some features/mechanics to it. For example, if you like Tetris, you can make it 3D and add combo blocks to it.

## Deadlines

- The jam will start in Saturday, Aban 8th (Oct 30th) at 00:00.
- It will end 3 weeks later in Saturday, Aban 29th (Nov 20th) at 00:00.

## Join and Submission Guide

- Join the jam from [THIS LINK](https://itch.io/jam/classic-games-remix) (You can join before the jam starts.)
- You have to create a GitHub repository for your game and submit the address to it when you're submitting your game. (Like previous HWs, you must commit your changes gradually.)
- You have to include your builds for at least **Windows** when you're submitting your game.
- Your game's Unity version must be `2019.4.9f1` or higher (but not 2020 or 2021)
- You have to create a list of features that you want to implement in your game. Include this list in your game repository's README file. You can use the checklist syntax in markdown files (search the keyword.)

## Requirements

You are free to design your game however you like. But make sure the amount of features and the implementation complexity of your game is _fair_. Based on your game, you may get up to 30% extra grades.

In general, make sure you use the different features of Unity and C# that we've talked about in class, like prefabs and scriptable objects.
